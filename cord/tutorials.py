And if not - there are tons of tutorials out there on the internet on how to do that.

**Warning:** I'm using *Nextcord* as my package of choice for programming Discord bots, because it worked the best for me.
If you get an error saying that Nextcord isn't compatible with another package,
simply uninstall it using a command like `pip uninstall discord.py`. 

Anyways, make sure you have all packages you need installed:
`pip install openai python-dotenv nextcord`.

We don't want our code to contain the secret API key and Discord bot token.
So create a `.env` file with the following content (obviously replace the values with the actual ones appropriately).:

```
NOVA_KEY=PUT_YOUR_NOVA_API_KEY_HERE
DISCORD_TOKEN=PUT_YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
```

And you should be good to go!

```py
